Pain means something important was lost.
Silence often hides the deepest feelings
Rushing forward can cause more hurt.
Being understood matters more than being solved.
Crying is not weakness — it’s release.
Some wounds need time, not answers.
Loneliness is worse than failure.
Remembering hurts, but forgetting hurts more.
Emotional weight should be shared, not carried alone.
Healing begins when feelings are allowed.
